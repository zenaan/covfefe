Honour Roll

This project begins in honour of Jim Bell of the cypherpunks mailing list, a courageous American
who took a stand on principle which is beyond the comprehension of many humans today.

In addition, in alphabetical order by family name, IQNets honours:


Andrew Anglin "Taking comedy a little further than the empire appreciates."
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Stormer
	The Daily Stormer is an American far-right neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and Holocaust denial
	commentary and message board website that advocates for the genocide of Jews.[2][3][4][5] It

	on July 4, 2013, as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website Total Fascism. The
	website also publishes its content in Spain and Latin America, Italy and Greece.

James Dalton ("Jim") Bell
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bell
	James Dalton Bell (born 1958) is an American crypto-anarchist who created the idea of
	arranging for anonymously sponsored assassination payments via the Internet, which he called
	"assassination politics".[2] He was imprisoned on felony charges of tax evasion in 1997.[2]
	In 2001, Wired called Bell "[o]ne of the Internet's most famous essayists"[3] and "the
	world's most notorious crypto-convict".[4]

Dr. David Ernest Duke
	https://davidduke.com/david-duke-answers-a-jewish-reader/
	I oppose the Jewish supremacists because implementation of their agenda in Western nations
	will eradicate my own people’s freedom and heritage. Hopefully, by now you have seen some of
	the overwhelming evidence I have cited on this issue. Jewish supremacists have been at the
	forefront of changing American immigration law as well as a host of other attacks on the
	heritage and freedom of European Americans. I enumerate them in many articles.


Dmitry Sklyarov
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Elcom_Ltd.
	United States v. ElcomSoft and Dmitry Sklyarov was a 2001–2002 criminal case in which Dmitry
	Sklyarov and his employer ElcomSoft were charged with alleged violation of the DMCA. The case
	raised some concerns of civil rights and legal process in the United States, and ended in the
	charges against Sklyarov dropped and Elcomsoft ruled not guilty under the applicable
	jurisdiction.
	Charges laid in the case were trafficking in, and offering to the public, a software program
	that could circumvent technological protections on copyrighted material, in violation of
	Section 1201(b)(1)(A)&(C) of Title 17 of the United States Code (the Copyright Acts,
	including most of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), as well as Sections 2 (Aiding and
	Abetting) and 371 (Conspiracy) of Title 18, Part I, of the United States Code (the Federal
	Criminal Code).
	The original issue came to the attention of prosecutors when Adobe Systems, a U.S. company,
	complained that copy protection arrangements in its e-book file format were being illegally
	circumvented by ElcomSoft's product. Adobe withdrew its complaint, but United States
	Department of Justice prosecutors (under the authority of local U.S. Attorney Robert S.
	Mueller, future Director of the FBI) declined to likewise drop the charges. ElcomSoft's
	product, and thus presumably the efforts of its employees including Sklyarov, were entirely
	legal in Russia. Sklyarov was eventually released on bail, but forced to remain in
	California, separated from his family, until his case concluded.


Dr. Richard Matthew Stallman

	I continue to be the Chief GNUisance of the GNU Project.
	I do not intend to stop any time soon.


Aaron Hillel Swartz
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz
	Swartz's work also focused on civic awareness and activism.[7][8] He helped launch the
	Progressive Change Campaign Committee in 2009 to learn more about effective online activism.
	In 2010, he became a research fellow at Harvard University's Safra Research Lab on
	Institutional Corruption, directed by Lawrence Lessig.[9][10] He founded the online group
	Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.
	In 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state
	breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked
	and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from
	JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT.[11][12] Federal prosecutors later
	charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and
	Abuse Act,[13] carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in
	prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.[14]
	Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison.
	Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his
	Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself.[15][16]


John Young

	information about freedom of expression, privacy, cryptography, dual-use technologies,
	national security, intelligence, and government secrecy.[5]

	Bin Laden,[8][9] lists of people allegedly associated with the Stasi,[10] and the PSIA.[11]

	anti-Irish Republican Army assassin Stakeknife[12] and the disputed internal emails of the
	WikiLeaks organization.[13] Cryptome republished the already public surveillance disclosures
	of Edward Snowden and announced in June 2014 that they would publish all unreleased Snowden
	documents later that month.[14
