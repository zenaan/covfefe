Micro Transport Protocol - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol
	Micro Transport Protocol or Î¼TP (sometimes also uTP) is an open UDP-based variant of the
	BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol intended to mitigate poor latency and other
	congestion control problems found in conventional BitTorrent over TCP, while providing
	reliable, ordered delivery.

	It was devised to automatically slow down[1] the rate at which packets of data are
	transmitted between users of peer-to-peer file sharing torrents when it interferes with other
	applications. For example, the protocol should automatically allow the sharing of an ADSL
	line between a BitTorrent application and a web browser.
