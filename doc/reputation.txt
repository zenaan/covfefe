way back when, i wrote a decentralized resource discovery protocol. key to this design was the concept of reputation among peers, and peer discovery weighted by reputation.

providing communication was a lightweight UDP protocol that could support tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal memory overhead and a single UDP socket.

by building peer reputation directly among a very large peer group, you developed a deep basis for ranking peers useful to you in the past, and likely to be useful in the future.

likewise, the useful peers of my useful peers are likely to be useful to me, and thus the recommendation engine proceeds...

rich reputation in decentralized networks is still a poorly explored space. this should change! :)


best regards,
