Jim, please read the updated README for IQNets here:
  https://github.com/zenaan/iqnets

IQNets (formerly covfefe net), begins in your honour, and we are
collectively in sincere gratitude to you - your stand is perhaps hard
for most humans to comprehend.

Someone should volunteer to write up your profile The Right Way,
since Wikipedia is a firetrucking wash out!

And when it comes to any donations, you are one of the few
individuals who would actually be trusted by myself and others, to
not agree to any compromize when receiving funds to support Tor
competition.

I'm not sure who to speak to in the USA, perhaps Eben Moglen since he
supported Richard Stallman a lot? I'm in Australia, and e.g. an
Australian not for profit structure (we have a few here), is unlikely
to be useful for USA donators who want USA tax deductibility.

I think seeking donations may be a little to soon, but I ABSOLUTELY
INSIST that you hold the authority on this front!

One of the major problems in the past is that good men allow others
who may be [ younger | more zealous | more vocal | more bold | what
ever ], to assume authority.

This broken dynamic has GOT to stop.

Good men must be A) recognized, B) acknowledged, C) be willing to
actually hold, and exercise, power.

If you wonder why every political system today is so rotten, re-read
the above!

Jim, one of your jobs, is to establish a not-for-profit structure for
the receiving of financial donations.

You are known as an amazing individual with rare human rights and
stoic/ staunch credibility. Marketing that appropriately is almost
irrelevant (and is easy to do) - but the first fact is, you exist,
you are who you are, and I personally trust you (and no doubt, many
others do too).

Real men gotta be alpha.

You need help, you ask!

I am personally only getting going on this, because of you, to
support you personally. I wanted to get going years ago, and really
wanted to handle other things a bit more for the next year, but we're
outta time, and you called, so here I am, answering your call! My own
contributions may be insufficient, but by the grace of our Creator,
it's what I have to offer. I am in service.

Do not let me down by failing to hold your own authority, with
dignity, and firmly.

Peace,
