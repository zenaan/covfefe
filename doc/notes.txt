Max decentralized P2P

Local logs (std web storage is 5MiB only) - implement local app.

Socket.io so that users can do P2P seemlessly from browser.

WebSocket is (was?) always TCP

If Trump is booted from Twitter/ needs an alt twitter platform, he has X millions of followers who subscribe to him.

centralization = censorship, ddos, crack target, user db target etc
	- stolen domains (e.g. dailstormer.com etc)
	- ddos to "encourage" hosting and running server behind cloudflare

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol

"tweets", activity streams, 

id, multiple IDs, choosing which data to share with friends

all data local

cryptobox udp

self certifying messages/tweets etc - i.e. decentral auth

when I want to subscribe, by default target id (e.g. a YAML snippet) should have a proxy, so that X millions don't target Trump's mobile phone with subscription requests

A user with a popular tweet could "go viral" in a matter of hours, and have millions want to follow them; so really, EVERYone needs a subscription proxy - this is just a queue

new friend:
	- email
	- phone number + text message
	- QR code on mobile ph display, photograph

ID means minimum priv/pub key, +nick

IDs need to be icons on the desktop/ phone - so user keeps them properly separated
	- install app
	- create IDs
	- creates e.g. desktop icon per ID
	- open/ double click app icon, opens web tab - this is one optional interface
	- app can have own interface

event based, YAML messages
each even stored locally, full history, optionally encrypted
trusted friends/ trust level
