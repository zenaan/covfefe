Peer Metrics

	peer == node
	friend == node with some level of meat space assigned "trust"

The low level of covfefe is about onion routing amongst identified peers.

To make routing decisions, we must know peers, so peer info must be shared/ distributed.

Entry nodes for important stuff (to you, the end user) means (sending receiving) via "trusted"
peers.

Node identification must be maintained to make routing decisions.

Node metrics must be maintained to make better routing decisions over time.

A node's declared metrics may or may not match discovered metrics.

Both declared and discovered metrics are stored per node.

Changes, i.e. events which cause changes, to metrics, are also stored.

At some point, older data may no longer be desirable to store.

Clearing all node data is a trivial task - destroy the LUKS keyblock for the history store.
