Hey, Offst is a digital credit card, powered by trust between people. It is
an open source project, licensed under AGPL3.

So far the main development on Offst was focused on designing a reasonable
open protocol, and on developing the core parts of Offst. One thing that
was neglected was a good graphical user interface.

I recently began on figuring out what an Offst mobile app would look like,
and so I sketched an initial draft for what the user flow should look like.

Any ideas are highly appreciated!
