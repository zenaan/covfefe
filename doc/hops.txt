How many hops are optimal?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the impatient end user who "just wants to view Facebook and do some online banking", any
noticeable delay, may be too much delay.  Parts of Tor's design are in reaction/ response to
this principle.

IQNets, to be an effective Tor replacement, needs to cater to many, hopefully all, types of
users.

This means users who have:

	- varying security requirements (from none, to "as much as possible")

	- varying bandwidth and latency requirements, in general which correspond to different types
	  of network activities or "network streams" or "end user applications"
		- see stream-types.txt

	- varying connectivity
		- permanent node
		- intermittent node (e.g. mobile phone getting turned on and off)


So for some users/uses, zero hops - i.e. direct to MSM website, is "better" if they are not
wanting security and averse to increases in latency.

Other uses demand the maximum security available, with possibly very high latency being
acceptable, or even desirable - e.g. high value text messages which just need to maximally
"disappear" (except for the recipient of course).

That's a point.

  GPA - Global Passive Adversary
  GAA - Global Active Adversary
  GT-1 - ??

"between two edge hosts (aka src and dst)" is the point why more than
say 3 to 9 hops adds little to nought - and if you're onion routing,
not only reducing bw by [header_size] per layer, but consuming
overall network bandwidth according to hop count (again, to little or
no advantage to privacy).

No increase in security in relation to conceivable attacks.

Jurisdictional hops - e.g. through Russia if you're avoiding USGov
etc - sound conceptually useful.

Link(s) to Phantom please?
