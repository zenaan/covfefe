A visit to Stack Exchange, Quora, Yahoo Questions, etc. will reveal
countless parrots declaring 'security through obscurity' a verboten taboo.
But when you devise an obscure scheme using many ciphers, and don't
publish the scheme, it does in fact significantly increase security. But
you are not allowed to say that. If you throw in a couple of unpublished
ciphers to the mix, it is even better. But again, you are not allowed to
say that. Saying it is akin to, "He said Jehosephat!"

True but I don't want to spell everything out. The reader must be led to
conclude some the implications.

You're welcome. Your mind is clean, unlike the others. I find this host
body suitable for my thoughts.

You down with OTP?

His spam and security protections are so stringent that not even his mum

I am stealing that (the rib eye is bossmonstrous). Can five eyes digest
the rib eyes?
