Re circuit switching, Tor does what's called onion routing, using TCP
circuits per onion layer.

This means A connects to B with a (encrypted) TCP connection, and
requests of B a next hop connection to C.

So B decrypts A's first layer incoming connection, which contains
A's encrypted connection to C, and B forwards the packets of that
connection, on to node C.

This layered encryption means B cannot read the contents of A's
connection with C.

It also is supposed to mean that because A's initial connection to B
is effective double encrypted, external onlookers should not be able
to determine that A is connecting to C, only that A is connecting to
B, but in practice to actually deliver this promise would require an
effective chaff fill mechanism, to actually obfuscate when and how
much data A sends to B, etc.
