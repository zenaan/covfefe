friends don't drop connections without warning (where possible) - IQNets provides a standard shutdown protocol where the user gives notice to peers of shutdown time - shortest is say 10 seconds, preferable is say 10 minutes;
friends/peers who receive "link shutdown" notice, can send a request asking e.g. "please give me 30 minutes" or etc.
