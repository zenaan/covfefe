NELB nodes (i.e. in the 14.4kbps class), give rise to consideration
of their primary use case being low b/w messaging systems.

If a node may transfer a maximum of only 1pps (packet per second),
consider a messaging layer

  - 1 packet per minute
  - fixed size packets
  - 1.4KiB packets


Some random nomenclature:

  - WD: node "sync window" duration, is 1 minute = 60s
  - WS: window wall clock start time, nego'd with peer
  - WE = WS + 60

  - PTD: estimated/avg packet transmission duration
  - PTDe: packet transmission duration error

  - PTS: packet transmission start time
  - PTE: packet transmission end time

  - Wi(PTS) = 60 - PTD - PTDe.max : window for possible values of PTS


Consider possible values for PTS, within each window WD:

  - PTS = PTS.min = 0
  - PTS = PTS.max = Wi(PTS)
  - PTS = rand(0,PTS.max)
  - PTS = nego fixed PTS with peer(s)
  - PTS = some algorithm (e.g. pseudo random, or nego'ed etc)

PTS might be nego'd on one side only, say between peers A and B, or
also in consultation with a third peer C, or with more than just a
third peer if we are creating a fan-out link/route.

The considerations for different values of PTS must include the
various network/ flow on effects - think dominoes of one node
affecting the next node etc.


--------
The limit case is an early 1990s modem link or slower, e.g. 14.4kbps or less than 2KiB/s.

With a UDP packet between 0.5 and 1.5KiB, we might be talking about 1 packet per second.

The types of comms activity suitable for such a network are limited, as some will recall - basic text based web pages, SMTP/POP, etc.

In this limit case, an overlay network as today's users would think of that, is not practical (since neither is "normal Internet surfing by today's standards"),

BUT, IQNets ought actually optimize such networks - with user (at the UI/GUI) insight into the types of traffic he wants to xfer, and design for certain high latency + low b/w text comms, an IQNet node may be quite a bit more practically useful than a plain W98 TCP stack.

1.5KiB/s ~= 126MiB per day, or about 3.5GiB/month.

Could we implement a useful high latency, low b/w text messaging overlay network in
3.5GiB/month?

Of course we could - which was likely the point of the early cypherpunks email mixnet experiments etc.
