Seems you should be building out your own
P2P fiber mesh guerrilla network house-to-house
owner-to-owner, each node independantly peering
up with others... don't rent the internet monthly...
be the internet.

Take less than 2 years of ISP fee, invest upfront
into independant P2P network node, easily
gets 10+ years P2P operations in return.

Did you know your central ISP spies on you,
allows other centrals to spy on you, gives
all your data away to big centrals.

Distributed private P2P network is much harder to
do that, especially when every link is independantly
privately owned and fulltime link encrypted 1 or 10 GigE,
and everyone is running overlays within.

Go do it.
