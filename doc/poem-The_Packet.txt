  The Packet
   Anon

  Oh packet, crypt packet, tell me, what be your meme?
  This secret you hide, a hint may I glean?

  "Some text for another, 'tis not you I tease,"
  "So forward me quickly, through your friends if you please!"

  "In chaff I must hide, tasty wheat for the ride,
  "Wait no longer, I linger, such importance inside!"


  Oh packet! Crypt packet .. go on and be free,
  To quietly, stealthily, target your creed!

  "Why thank, dear kind Sir, you good will be true,
  "For free speech, anon speech, good causes anew!"

  "Now I shall depart, you may have the last laugh,"
  "We be daŋkə schön, muffas! 'Member, give from yo heart..."
