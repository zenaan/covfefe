Napkin calculations are important when it comes to such numbers as 7
billion.

In terms of routing, if we create a flat "whole earth altnet" address
space, this also implies that each node needs to know, or may need to
know, or may be directly contacted by (sooner or later), every other
node on earth - all 7 billion if we assume on average one node per
human.

So we can say things like:

  - assume that node identification and all node metrics, are stored
    in 1KiB of data

and so each node will sooner or later need to store, at an absolute
minimum, 7 * 10^9 * 1024*8 (1KiB of bits) / 8 / 1024^3 ~= 6,675 GiB !

So we must compress that (again, assuming a flat virtual network
for the time being, ignoring natural physical proximities and natural
physical grouping/clumpiness).

Let's say a node_info requires:
 - IPv6 altnet address - 128 bits
 - say 5-bits per metric, and 6 metrics (stat fields) = 30 bits
 - a few booleans (node blocked by me, "friend", "known" etc) - say
   30 bits
 - a display name is desired, say on average compressed to 160 bits

IF the above is sufficient, we have now ~348 bits per node, instead
of 8192 (1 kibibyte = 1024 * 8 = 8192 bits), and our node static
storage requirement (for end user routing) becomes:

  7 * 10^9 * 348 / 8 / 1024^3 = ~ 283 GiB

Now we reduce storage costs by assuming that, from my personal node
perspective, the majority of people in the world (the majority of
nodes) will fit within a bell curve of "average", and can be treated
as such, until and unless they identify themselves as not average
(either preferred, or avoided or blocked, again, by me) - other than
that, most folks will not distinguish themselves to me, they will be
in the set "unknown" and otherwise uninteresting.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution

Ultimate bell curve density is an empirical matter, but for now we
can make the averaging assumptions, pluck a random normal deviate out
of thin air statistics to please ourselves and say it'll be a
standard normal distribution and that the only interesting nodes (out
of 7 billion) are gonna be beyond the second sigma - i.e. no more
than about ~5%, as ~95% will be "normal".

(Defining "normal" in the context of "empirical metrics for a node I
 am currently connected to" shall come later.)

So, 5% of 7 billion = ~350 million nodes of interest, multiplied by
~348 bits (for long term per-interesting-node storage) gives:

  7 * 10^9 * 0.05 * 348 / 8 / 1024^3 = ~ 14 GiB

Still too high for a mobile phone, albeit in the realms of
"possible today".

We can obviously get rid of display names (these are bulk
"interesting" but not "known friends" nodes), and assume for now 5
instead of 30 state bits per node:

  7 * 10^9 * 0.05 * 163 / 8 / 1024^3 = ~ 6.6 GiB

And if we change our random normal distribution assumption to 3
standard deviations being "normal" (~0.3% abnormal/metriced), we get:

  7 * 10^9 * 0.003 * 163 / 8 / 1024^3 = ~ 400 MiB

And finally we're in the realm of "possibly reasonable".

Of course, the most interesting sets are "those I choose to regularly
connect to" and "those I completely block", so we can likely get that
400MiB down a bit further still...
