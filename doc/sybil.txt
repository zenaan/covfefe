Sybil attacks:

 - our not so friendly neighbourhood GPAs (global passive
   adversaries), are extraordinarily well funded, and can thus out
   compete us in any trustLESS net

 - this is why we have no option but to establish at least some
   minimum base peer set, which is "trusted" to some level
   - thus the necessity for meat-space "human connections"

 - "trust" must be, at least to some (and known) degree, actually
   established by the end user

 - an end user must establish at least TWO, trusted peers
   - possibly more than 2 is the absolute minimum, idk, and the
     statistical/ metrics side of this is a prime academic study
     target

 - one may trust peers run by a party one has not met physically -
   relationships may be established over years online without meeting
   the person, and a known base level of trust arise implicitly
   therefrom
