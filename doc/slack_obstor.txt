A new globally distributed P2P autonomously
self maintaining deduplicating plug and play
slack space object storage network could easily
surpass 100EB...

"slack space" - network utilizes say 80% of free
space on disk for itself, maintains that by progressively
removing its own extents upon sensing storage pressure
encroaching the remaining 20% (from users other apps),
adds more extents if users space later decreases.

Some data expiry models exist as natural byproduct
in a number of types of storage networks...

- Equal resource sharing / trading, pay based...
prioritizes the equal player, highest payer, etc.
- Curation, review, governance... follows the whim
bias demand and censorship of those actors / crowd
- Seed based networks... survive until the last seed.

These types also don't support insert and disconnect
operations very well... indigent artists, first leaks,
bulk publishers, etc.

Prior attempts at distributed self maintaining
object storage networks may have assumed that
demand fallof is the only valid metric to expiry.

In absense of the three above, short term flash
demand is news, thus always valid.

Long term, things start looking different,
unpopular and or old hashes often begin
to hold term value and importance.

Models for a network open to the masses,
that happens to prune historical top N hashes at
each hashes respective M year accounting point,
may be unlikely to lose anything of importance perhaps
due to eventual popular reuploading from other sources.

Designers of new nets may want to consider priortizing
any space reclamation needs based on some analysis of
real world "popular pop trash" content falloff patterns, some
physical library, museum, and attic holdings models, inverse
falloff metrics, internally guaranteed levels of object redundancy,
etc.

Are any current networks autonomous, free from
three models above?
