Note below that "availability" ~= "over duration", which in this context is a QoS metric of some sort.

Of course, X bps for T period, is a similar way to say
transfer Y MiB "at your convenience" and nego bandwidth.

Remember that

  (total) xfer = bandwidth x time

and so of course

  time = xfer / bandwidth

and similarly

  bandwidth = xfer / time

, and so pick the forumla you need for the inputs you have,
to determine the request/ consequence (e.g. what to nego).
