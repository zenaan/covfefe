What is "trust"?

 - "I trust you, to the extent that I can predict your behaviour"
   - A friend, 2012.

 - Trust is ultimately a presumption, only ever a temporary proof in the
   face of life events.

 - Actions of a peer (/"friend") in the face of adversity, suggest the
   level to which that peer can be trusted.

 - Testing a peer, provides data points for trust.

 - Events, particularly those in the face of life's adversarial events,
   provides data points for trust

 - How a human behaves in the micro test, is typically echoed in any
   macro tests.

 - How many humans do you know, who would go to jail for you, for the
   principle of your right to freedom of communication, rather than sell
   you out to the Federal Police by installing a sniffer on all your
   network traffic ?

 - Aligning with the interests of powerful interests, can also provide a
   measure of trust ("predictable outcomes").
   - This is the prime modality of those at Tor Inc., thus their sellout
	 of Jacob Applebaum - his living of the right to run an independent
	 directory authority, was the prime cause for him to ultimately be
	 lynched.
