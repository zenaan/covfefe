What is "trust"?

	- "I trust you, to the extent that I can predict your behaviour"
		- A friend, 2012.

	- Trust is ultimately a presumption, only ever a temporary proof in the face of life events.

	- Events, particularly those in the face of life's adversarial events, provides data points
	  for trust

	- Actions of a peer (/"friend") in the face of adversity, suggest the level to which that
	  peer can be trusted.

	- some events, e.g. Jim Bell's refusal to plead guilty, and the extended years of jail he
	  suffered as a result of his stand, are compelling events in relation to an individual and
	  how they may be trusted

	- Testing a peer, provides data points for trust, "metrics" if we are testing e.g. network
	  performance.

	- How a human behaves in the micro test, is sometimes echoed in larger 'life events'.

	- How many humans do you know, who would go to jail for you, for the principle of your right
	  to freedom of communication, rather than sell you out to the Federal Police by installing
	  a sniffer on all your network traffic ?

	- Aligning with the interests of powerful interests, can also provide a measure of trust
	  ("predictable outcomes"), though usually by compromise of some other right or interest that
	  you have.
		- This is the prime modality chosen by those at Tor Inc., thus their sellout of Jacob
		  Applebaum - his living of the right to run an independent directory authority, a or the
		  prime cause for him being publicly lynched (in the modern sense of being lynched).
