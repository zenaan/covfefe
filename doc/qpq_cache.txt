One consequence of quid pro quo (QPQ) cache tokens, is that if I want
my latest 'tube to be replicated X times, and I am relying on QPQ
cache of other nodes, I will need to offer the amount of storage I am
seeking - if my vid is 100MiB, and I want 3x replication, and I must
QPQ (i.e. offer a storage token in order to obtain a storage tokens
from others), this means I must offer to cache 300MiB, in order to
get my vid cached 3x.

Plus presumably I am storing my vid, which means 4x copies of the vid.

Next, as torrents do today, sane P2P protocols should strongly
incentivize "making available for upload, that which I download/ view".

Availability metrics can include, for the proactive vlogger,
randomized "QPQ cache block" checks - d/l and check the SHA, store
availability/ validity metrics accordingly.
