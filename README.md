# IQNets

Freedom has a price which we must pay, if we wish to live in freedom.

Failure to pay that price, even by way of acquiescense, is the endless slide into slavery.

A free people are willing to pay the price which freedom demands.

Intellectually honest humans who uphold our fundamental human rights, support those who live in
pursuance of our human rights.

This project, IQNets, begins in humble honour of and in deep gratitude to
**James Dalton ("Jim") Bell**.

Jim's principled stand (which he holds to this day), having rejected a 2 year "plea deal" by
pleading guilty (which would have whitewashed the USA prosecutor's evil) cost him 13 years of
his life in a USA federal prison, by the hand of various corrupt USA federal prosecutors and
associated humans.

IQNets shall be a privacy enhancing "encrypted" network of networks or "mesh net" which is
intended to overcome certain of the specific, known and fundamental failings of the Tor ("The
Onion Router") network - primarily:

 1. Centralised directory authorities with "special status".
 2. Complete avoidance of chaff fill anonymisation protocols.
 3. TCP base protocol, facilitating Tor network connection tracking especially at entry to the
    Tor network, and which also mandates the unavoidable TCP bandwidth and latency overheads,
    for all non connection oriented protocols which some people try to run on the Tor network.

These problems with Tor have been known since Tor's inception and assiduously avoided being
fixed by the USA's Pentagon- and CIA- funded Tor project.

Further, the Tor project's directory authorities included one relatively independent directory
authority run by Jacob Applebaum who refused to hand over his authority in the Tor project, and
who due to his stand, was thereafter targetted by other specific humans both within and without
the Tor project in a vicious public "online lynch" mob campaign against him; Applebaum has since
had his directory authority "reassigned" to a more compliant individual.

So, use Tor at your own risk assessment.


## Technical Basics

IQNets by design are/is founded on the following technical computer networking principles:

 - packet switched (initially UDP)
 - chaff filled (by peer negotiation per end user configuration)
 - end-user node routed (no directory authorities)
 - friend to friend for primary trust, but allowing "unknown" nodes per config
 - privacy enhancing (every claim of guaranteed "anonymity" is asking end users to decieve
   themselves and thereby put themselves at risk)
 - communications networks
 - for all types of digital communications - tweets to torrents, web browsing to phone calls

The design of IQNets begins late October 2019.

IQNets shall be ready when it's ready, and not before.

Time frame for even a "techy admins only prototype" is "Not Sure" (with thanks to Idiocracy the
movie).

(IQNets is Renamed from "Covfefe Opportunistic VPN For Encrypted F2F Exchange" - Covfefe shall
 be my trigger memeing chat client (running on IQNets) instead :)


## Status

As at October 2019: design and consideration, intent to code Proof of Concept once the basic
concepts are settled; discussion ongoing at the cpunks.org "Cypherpunks" email mailing list and
with the analyses and notes fed into text files located under `doc/` .
